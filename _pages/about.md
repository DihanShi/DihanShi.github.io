I am a doctoral student in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/) at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). I study comparative public opinion and political communication. My research on corruption perceptions and public support for free trade has received an invitation to revise and resubmit from [*International Studies Quarterly*](https://academic.oup.com/isq).

Prior to joining Washington University, I was a Research Data Analyst at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) (2023). I hold a B.S. degree *summa cum laude* in Mathematics (with Honors) and Political Economy (with Honors) from [Georgetown University](https://www.georgetown.edu/) (2022). 

You can access my CV [here](/files/Dihan_Shi_CV.pdf). My email is [dihan@wustl.edu](mailto:dihan@wustl.edu).
