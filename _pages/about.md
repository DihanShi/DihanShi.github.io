I am a PhD student in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis.

I use spatial statistics, geospatial analysis, and survey experiments to study comparative political economy and public opinion. My research has been [published](publications) in *International Studies Quarterly*.

Prior to joining Washington University, I was a Research Data Analyst at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (2023). I hold a B.S. degree *summa cum laude* in Mathematics (*Honors*) and Political Economy (*Honors*) from Georgetown University (2022).

I am also a violinist. I was concertmaster of the [Georgetown University Orchestra](https://performingarts.georgetown.edu/participate/perform/music-ensembles/) (2021-2022) and a first violinist with the [University of North Carolina Symphony Orchestra](https://music.unc.edu/undergraduate/ensembles/uncso/) (2019-2020).
