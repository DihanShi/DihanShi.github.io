I am a doctoral student in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis.

I use survey experiments and computer vision to study comparative political economy, public opinion, and political communication. I also study causal inference problems in survey experimentation and remote sensing. My research on individual corruption perceptions and public support for free trade is conditionally accepted for publication in [*International Studies Quarterly*](https://academic.oup.com/isq).

Prior to joining Washington University, I was a Research Data Analyst at Johns Hopkins University (2023). I hold a B.S. degree *summa cum laude* in Mathematics (with Honors) and Political Economy (with Honors) from Georgetown University (2022). 

I am also a violinist. I was concertmaster of the [Georgetown University Orchestra](https://performingarts.georgetown.edu/participate/perform/music-ensembles/) (2021-2022) and a first violinist with the [University of North Carolina Symphony Orchestra](https://music.unc.edu/undergraduate/ensembles/uncso/) (2019-2020).
