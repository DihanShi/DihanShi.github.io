I am a PhD student in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. Additionally, I am an Editorial Assistant for Replication at [*Political Analysis*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/).

I study modern and contemporary state building, conflict, and public opinion. Particularly, I focus on the political effects of human geography and state presence. Methodologically, I use spatial statistics, geospatial analysis, network analysis, and survey experiments. My research has been [published](publications) in *International Studies Quarterly* and conditionally accepted at the *Journal of Experimental Political Science*.

I hold a M.A. degree (*en passant*) in Political Science from Washington University, and a B.S. degree *summa cum laude* in Mathematics (*Honors*) and Political Economy (*Honors*) from Georgetown University.

I am also a violinist. I was concertmaster of the [Georgetown University Orchestra](https://performingarts.georgetown.edu/participate/perform/music-ensembles/) (2021-2022) and a first violinist with the award-winning [University of North Carolina Symphony Orchestra](https://music.unc.edu/undergraduate/ensembles/uncso/) (2019-2020).
